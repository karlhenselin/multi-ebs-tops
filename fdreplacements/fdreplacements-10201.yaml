# To get started type 'replacement-' and select the template you want to use.
# YAML uses backslash as its escape character and eats the first layer of quote marks.
# Use Double Quotes around values containing '$' or '{'.

# To reference a FlexDeploy property, use the property name directly. No need to prefix with $. Example FD_ENVIRONMENT_CODE.
